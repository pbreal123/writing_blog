# Ames Housing Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices in Ames, Iowa, using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features of houses, and we will apply different regression models to estimate their sale prices.

## Libraries Used

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization.
- `seaborn`: For enhanced data visualization.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning models and metrics.

## Ames Housing Dataset

The Ames Housing dataset is a comprehensive dataset that includes various features of residential properties in Ames, Iowa. It contains information such as:

- SalePrice: The property's sale price.
- Lot Area: The size of the lot in square feet.
- Year Built: The year the property was built.
- Total Rooms: The total number of rooms in the house.
- And many more features that describe the properties.

The dataset is well-suited for regression tasks, and we aim to predict the sale price based on the provided features.
